His ACL injury actually benefits a team like Dallas because maybe that is how a guy like that falls all the way to #27.  I doubt he falls that far, but I have been asked a number of times if I would take him if he does drop to Dallas, despite the needs this team has elsewhere.  My answer is not even required a 2nd thought.  Absolutely.  He is a guy who appears to be a stud and as close to a can’t miss prospect at RB that we have seen in a half-dozen drafts.  I don’t know how he would get to #27, but it would require no hesitation.  He is going to be something in the NFL.",

For me, it will require teams to operate under the premise of what he was in 2013 to take him in the top 60, and believe that once he heels and maybe drops 10 pounds that he goes back to being that special talent we have all known about for so long.  He definitely has attributes that you really like, but I am quite perplexed about the issues that jumped out at me when going through his 200 snaps to see the current version of TJ Yeldon. As it stands, I would not be certain at pick #60, which I am sure puts me in the minority.",

He might grow into it, but I would like a 2-man situation if I am going to select Johnson and make him demonstrate that he can do even more.  It is just so difficult to disregard that mountain of evidence that for this particular position, the speed of play is important and the major conferences dominate the successful lists in the last decade on Sundays.  That said, he has done so much and tested so well that you disregard his credentials at your own risk.  He checks many of the boxes for you to trust that he has some real ability, and with his special teams ability and his receiving, the floor on what he could be is still pretty good at the right price.  Sometimes it is best to admit that you aren’t sure. I am not sure.  I like him and he is talented, but I confess that my level of certainty changes depending on which game I am viewing.",

He made one of the most amazing plays of the season (shown above), but for any observer, we spend more time wondering why the safeties of USC were standing by rather than making an actual attempt at knocking down the ball. But, he can really win on a ball and has versatility in route running that shows off nearly the entire route tree and has explosiveness in the air that allows him to dominate for a ball with that “catch radius” that we look for in a #1 WR. He is very good against zone coverages and underneath out of the slot. He also blocks with a vengeance and below you can see him look for a knockout block in the middle of the field that would impress Hines Ward.",

These two things make him very difficult to match when the ball is in the air.  Ohio State would put him in the slot and run him on the 9 route against whoever the matchup would be and it was generally a major opportunity for the Buckeyes to win big.  They literally ran the same play for touchdowns against Wisconsin twice in the 1st Quarter of their 59-0 win.  He is too fast and too capable to get the ball for there to be any other result.  He also has a real impressive knack with the over the shoulder catch.  His combo of go routes combined with simple stops and curls make him a either/or route guy who is very solid in that department.",

Rather, he is going to be in that next class as either a 1b or a 2 type receiver who will also immediately impact your return game.

He just needed to find a spot where he is exceptional, and on the inside – center or either guard – he can dominate and really turn into an anchor that you set your line around. Dallas fans will tell you that everything on the offense started turning around when they got a top-class center in the middle to patrol any sort of challenges opponents would want to present.  Erving can be that guy for someone.",

He is as strong as you can imagine with 37 reps on the bench press and his feet are quite impressive. This one might come down to your coaching staff and your faith in them to bring him along.

Fisher should be very solid as a NFL player and may continue to develop, but his ultimate upside is highly debated, and for me, I see him below the top tier of prospects for many of these questions.

He needs to go to a 3-4 team, but from there, I don’t see why he can’t keep causing chaos at the NFL level by finding your sacks on passing downs.

In a league where speed is being emphasized over pop, a player who plays with pop is completely reliant on getting to a team that plans to use you properly.

He is just not very interested in going up to help in run support much or in attacking the multiple bubble screens or quick outs that we see in the game these days.  I need my corner to be a physical man on the flank, especially at that size. I just don’t see that consistently as you could accuse him of too many “business decisions” as a corner that may count Deion Sanders as an inspiration.  Sanders is one of the all-time greats, but there were times where “team defense” never seemed like a great priority, and Peters is the same way. He also looks like he is an outside guy who doesn’t have the quicks underneath to stay with the smaller slot receivers, so if you want a bigger corner who will plays outside and make breaks on the ball, I think he will be be fine and likely a 1st rounder.  But, if you want corners who think they are bigger than they really are and love to dive-bomb a play underneath, Peters is not your guy.",

He has the mentality and the makeup that I look for in a corner, and unlike Peters from Washington, he is far more ready to attack the line of scrimmage and is a team defender which make his abilities far more useful to me.  I am confident that this player has the skill-set that is required to deal with the challenges that are ahead and he has all the attributes you are looking for in a 1st round corner.  He also looks able to contribute on special teams and provide depth.  If you are Dallas and in need for a scheme fit with tremendous upside and looks to be a real value, I believe this player would be pretty high on the list if he falls to #27.

He is a real nice player, but I don’t think he would last long as a press corner on Sundays.  He just doesn’t seem to have the natural instincts to handle a quick threat in space and then find the ball at the moment of truth.
