His ACL injury actually benefits a team like Dallas because maybe that is how a guy like that falls all the way to #27.  I doubt he falls that far, but I have been asked a number of times if I would take him if he does drop to Dallas, despite the needs this team has elsewhere.  My answer is not even required a 2nd thought.  Absolutely.  He is a guy who appears to be a stud and as close to a can’t miss prospect at RB that we have seen in a half-dozen drafts.

He is a real nice player, but I don’t think he would last long as a press corner on Sundays.  He just doesn’t seem to have the natural instincts to handle a quick threat in space and then find the ball at the moment of truth.

Projecting what a guy who is 23 years old (in July) can be in a few years with hard coaching is very difficult to say without knowing what staff gets him and how much you plan on playing him in 2015.
