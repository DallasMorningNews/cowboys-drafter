# cowboys-drafter
Working repository for the cowboys-drafter "app"

<h3>Project scope</h3>

This app will allow the user to take on the role of the GM of the Dallas Cowboys for the first three rounds of the NFL draft. Users will be able to select which position they think the team should draft in each of the first three rounds, then pick from a pool of players that match that position.

After each player is selected for each round, the user will advance to the next round. Once the user has picked players for the first three rounds, they'll be able to share their picks on facebook and/or twitter, and see how their picks match up against other users.

Stumped on a round? Get SportsDay writer Jon Machota's pick for that position.
